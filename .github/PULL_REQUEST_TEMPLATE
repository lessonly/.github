### Setup/Preparation:

_List any steps a reviewer should take to prepare for testing, but that aren't a part of the feature itself_

- [ ] Enabled these Feature flags
  - List any feature flags the reviewer needs here
  -
- [ ] Create test data
- [ ] Open up a rails console
- [ ] Visit a page

### Feature testing steps:

_List all steps to test the feature. Try to split up steps into managable sections so the review can work in batches_

**Section Name**

- [ ] Visit this page
- [ ] Click a button
- [ ] Close a modal

**Section Name**

- [ ] Visit another page
- [ ] Delete something
- [ ] Add a title

_If you have written frontend code (displays to a user) you should also test in these browsers_

**Browser Compatibility**

- [ ] Chrome or Firefox (Preferred browser)
- [ ] iOS Safari
- [ ] IE11
